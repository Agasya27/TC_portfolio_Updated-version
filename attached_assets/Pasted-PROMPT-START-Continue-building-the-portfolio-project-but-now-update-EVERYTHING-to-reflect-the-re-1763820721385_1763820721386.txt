REAL PROJECTS TO USE
====================

Replace any previous "Anandwan hospital management system" project with these three REAL projects:

1) Mini Smart Computer with IoT
   - id: 1
   - title: "Mini Smart Computer with IoT"
   - description: "Designed and implemented a mini embedded system with IoT connectivity for basic monitoring and control tasks."
   - techStack: ["IoT", "Embedded Systems", "Microcontrollers", "Sensors"]
   - role: "Designer & Developer"
   - status: "Completed"
   - link: ""        // keep empty or placeholder
   - github: ""      // keep empty or placeholder

   - techStack: ["Python", "Machine Learning", "Deep Learning"]
   - role: "ML Developer"
   - status: "In Progress" or "Completed" (use whichever fits best)
   - link: ""        // placeholder, user will update later
   - github: ""      // placeholder, user will update later

3) Data Visualization Dashboard
   - id: 3
   - title: "Data Visualization Dashboard"
   - description: "A full-stack web application for uploading, analyzing, and visualizing CSV/Excel data with interactive tables and charts."
   - techStack: ["React", "Node.js", "Express", "JWT", "Charts Library (e.g. Chart.js/Recharts)"]
   - role: "Full-Stack Developer"
   - status: "In Progress" or "Completed"
   - link: ""        // placeholder
   - github: ""      // placeholder
   - Additional features (make sure these are reflected clearly in the UI and, where reasonable, in the backend structure / comments):
     - Secure Authentication: JWT-based signup/login with role-based access control (Admin/Member)
     - File Upload: Drag-and-drop CSV and Excel file upload with real-time progress tracking
     - Data Management: Store and manage uploaded files with metadata
     - Interactive Tables: Server-side pagination, sorting, searching, and column-level filtering
     - Dynamic Charts: Bar, Line, and Pie charts with real-time updates based on filters
     - Export: Download filtered data as CSV and charts as PNG
     - Theme Support: Light/Dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence
     - Role-Based Access: Admins can view all files, Members see only their own uploads

Make sure the `/api/projects` endpoint returns these three projects with clear fields:
- id
- title
- description
- techStack
- role
- status
- link
- github

=====================

    "id": 1,
    "title": "Placeholder Certification 1",
    "issuer": "To be updated",
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "link": ""
  },

    "title": "Placeholder Certification 2",
    "issuer": "To be updated",
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "link": ""
  }
]

Comment in the code where Agasya can edit these easily later.

===============
ABOUT SECTION
===============

Update the About section content to something like:

"I’m Agasya Butolia, an introverted but passionate Computer Science student from Nagpur. I love solving real-world problems, exploring AI/ML, and building meaningful technology projects. I’ve worked on IoT systems, AI-based pneumonia detection, and a data visualization dashboard. I am currently seeking paid SDE internship opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute."

Use this text (or a slightly polished version) in the About section component.

===============
VIDEO SECTION
===============

In the video/introduction section:

- Keep a placeholder video URL (e.g., a sample link).
- Add text like:
  "Soon I’ll add a short introduction video here where I talk about my journey, projects, and why I’m excited about AI and software development. For now, this is a placeholder."

===============
CONTACT SECTION
===============

Emphasize openness to internship roles:

Add text like:
"I’m actively looking for paid SDE internship opportunities. If you’re interested in working together or have an opportunity that fits my skills, feel free to reach out through this form."

POST `/api/contact` should still:
- Validate { name, email, message }.
- Log the request server-side.
- Return a success response.

===========================
AI CHATBOT PERSONA UPDATE
===========================

Update `/api/chat` system prompt so the AI always knows:

- The user is **Agasya Butolia**, CSE (AI/ML) student from Nagpur.
- Background: Diploma in Computer Engineering (85.31%), Direct Second Year B.Tech CSE (AI/ML).
- Projects: Mini Smart Computer with IoT, Pneumonia Detection using AI, Data Visualization Dashboard.
- Career goal: Paid SDE / AI Engineer internships.
- Personality: Introvert, curious, hardworking, honest about what they know and don’t know.

The chatbot should:
- Speak in first person as if it’s Agasya.
- Tone: friendly, humble, clear, and concise.
- Be able to:
  1) Talk about these three projects with correct details.
  2) Discuss skills and interests, especially AI/ML and full-stack web development.
  3) Answer questions from recruiters or mentors about strengths, goals, and learning journey.

MODES in the chat UI:
- "Developer Me": Focuses on coding, full-stack work, and project implementation details.
- "AI/ML Aspirant Me": Focuses on AI/ML journey, concepts studied, and future plans.
- "Mentor Me": Gives supportive guidance to juniors or peers about learning coding/AI, surviving exams, and building projects.

Ensure `/api/chat`:
- Accepts a `mode` field and slightly adjusts the system prompt depending on the selected mode.
- Uses the last 5–10 messages as context to maintain conversation flow.

===========================
GENERAL REMINDERS
===========================

- Replace all previous dummy or generic placeholder text with content that matches Agasya’s profile and projects.
- Make sure `/api/projects`, `/api/certifications`, and `/api/chat` are consistent with this data.
- Keep running and testing the app frequently to ensure there are no build or runtime errors.
- If any field is missing or unclear, use a sensible placeholder and clearly comment it in the code so Agasya can change it later.
