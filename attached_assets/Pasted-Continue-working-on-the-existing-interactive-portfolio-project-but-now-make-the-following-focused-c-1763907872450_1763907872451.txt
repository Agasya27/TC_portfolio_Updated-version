Continue working on the existing interactive portfolio project, but now make the following focused changes and improvements.

DO NOT rebuild the whole project. Only modify the relevant components (Hero/Name text, Projects section, Contact section) as described below.

====================================================
1) HERO SECTION – ANIMATED NAME TEXT
====================================================

In the Hero section where my name is displayed ("Agasya Butolia"):

- Add a **good-looking text animation** to my name.
- The animation should:
  - Be smooth and modern (e.g., typewriter effect, fade-in with slight scale, or letter-by-letter reveal).
  - Run when the page loads or when the Hero section comes into view.
  - Not be too aggressive or flashy; it should feel professional.

Implementation suggestions (choose one that fits the current stack):
- Use CSS animations or Tailwind with keyframes.
- Or use Framer Motion if it’s already installed.
- Keep the animation logic in a clean component (e.g., `AnimatedName`).

Make sure this does NOT break responsiveness or layout on mobile.

====================================================
2) PROJECTS SECTION – REMOVE IMAGES, ADD GITHUB LINKS
====================================================

In the Projects section:

- Remove any **project images/thumbnails** that are currently being displayed.
- For each project card, add a **“View on GitHub” button or link** that points to these URLs:

  Project 1 – Mini Smart Computer with IoT  
  - GitHub: https://github.com/Agasya27/mini-computer-with-implementation-of-IOT

  Project 2 – Pneumonia Detection using AI  
  - GitHub: https://github.com/Agasya27/pneumonia-detection-ML-pro

  Project 3 – Data Visualization Dashboard  
  - GitHub: https://github.com/Agasya27/Data-Visualization-Dashboard

Update the project data (backend `/api/projects` or frontend mapping, whichever is used) so that:
- Each project has a `github` field set to the corresponding URL above.
- The UI shows a nice button/link (e.g., “GitHub Repo”) that opens the repo in a new tab.

Keep the cards clean and attractive, but with NO images, only text + buttons/badges.

====================================================
3) CONTACT SECTION – ADD WEB3FORMS INTEGRATION
====================================================

In the Contact section, I want the form to submit via **Web3Forms**.

- Integrate **Web3Forms** with the existing contact form.
- Use the standard Web3Forms HTML form pattern, for example:
  - `action="https://api.web3forms.com/submit"`
  - `method="POST"`
- Add the hidden `access_key` input with a placeholder value and a clear comment for me to replace later, for example:
  - `<input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY_HERE" />`
- Keep the existing fields: **name, email, message** (and any others that make sense).
- Show a **success / error message** in the UI after submission (use Web3Forms response, or a simple optimistic UI if you can’t access details).

You can:
- Either switch the form to use Web3Forms instead of the `/api/contact` backend endpoint,
- Or keep `/api/contact` for other purposes but make sure the visible contact form submits to Web3Forms.

Make sure the form still looks nice with Tailwind styling.

====================================================
4) CONTACT SECTION – ADD MY EMAIL VISIBLY
====================================================

In the Contact/Contact Me section, also:

- Add my email address **visibly** so that people can contact me directly:
  - `agasyabutolia@gmail.com`
- Make it a clickable `mailto:` link, styled cleanly (e.g., small icon + text or a simple link with underline on hover).
- Place it near the contact form with a short line like:
  - “You can also email me directly at: [email link]”

====================================================
5) VISUAL POLISH (OPTIONAL BUT APPRECIATED)
====================================================

Where appropriate, enhance the visual design slightly so that:

- The animated name in the Hero section stands out nicely.
- The project cards look balanced without images (use spacing, borders, shadows, hover effects).
- The Contact section feels cohesive with the rest of the site.

Do NOT introduce new pages or big structural changes. Just refine what’s there.

====================================================
IMPORTANT
====================================================

- Do NOT remove my existing project data or chatbot integration.
- Do NOT break the build or introduce runtime errors.
- Only modify what’s necessary to:
  - Animate my name text in the Hero.
  - Remove project images and add GitHub links (with the exact URLs provided).
  - Integrate Web3Forms into the Contact form.
  - Add my visible email address `agasyabutolia@gmail.com` in the Contact section.

When you’re done, briefly describe:
- Which files you edited.
- What kind of animation you used for my name.
- How the Web3Forms integration is wired and where I should paste my `access_key`.
