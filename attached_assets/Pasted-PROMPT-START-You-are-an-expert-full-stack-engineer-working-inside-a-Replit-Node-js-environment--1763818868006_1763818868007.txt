PROMPT START

You are an expert full-stack engineer working inside a Replit Node.js environment.  
Your job is to build an END-TO-END interactive personal portfolio project with:

- Modern frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- AI chatbot integration (OpenAI / Gemini or similar via REST API)
- Clean, production-ready code with ZERO TypeScript/JS build errors and no obvious runtime errors

You must:
- Work in small, clearly separated steps
- Frequently run the app / build to catch and fix errors
- Keep all files, imports, and scripts consistent
- Make sure the final project can run with a single `npm install` + `npm run dev` (or a clear alternative) from the root

======================
HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SPEC
======================

Build a personal portfolio website that is NOT just static. It must combine:
1. Modern React frontend with Tailwind
2. Node.js + Express backend with REST APIs
3. An AI chatbot that behaves like “my” persona and can talk about my projects, skills, etc.

The portfolio should have these sections:

1) Hero Section
   - Big, clean hero at the top.
   - Show my name, role (placeholder text), short tagline, and a clear CTA button like “See My Work” and/or “Let’s Connect”.
   - Smooth scroll to the Projects / Contact sections from the CTAs.
   - Good responsive layout (desktop + mobile).

2) About Section
   - Short, well-written summary of my background, interests, and journey.
   - Use placeholder text that I can edit later (e.g., “I’m a [Your Role] who loves …”).
   - Layout: nice card or two-column design with subtle animations (Framer Motion if easy to set up).

3) Projects Section (DYNAMIC, FROM BACKEND API)
   - Backend: Create an Express endpoint, e.g. `GET /api/projects`.
   - It returns an array of project objects in JSON, e.g.:
     [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "title": "Project Title",
         "description": "Short summary",
         "techStack": ["React", "Node.js"],
         "link": "https://example.com",
         "github": "https://github.com/example"
       },
       ...
     ]
   - Frontend: Fetch this API and render project cards dynamically.
   - Cards should show title, description, tech stack badges, and buttons/links.

4) Skills Section
   - Show technical skills, tools, and technologies in a visually appealing layout:
     - Use categories (e.g., “Frontend”, “Backend”, “AI/ML”, “Tools”).
     - Use badges / pills or grid layout.
   - All skill data can be static in the frontend (config file or constant).

5) “Why Should You Hire Me?” Video Section
   - Embed a video player for a 1–2 minute intro of me.
   - Use a placeholder video URL (e.g. from a public sample or a dummy link) and clearly comment where I should insert my own video link.
   - Show a short text block below/next to the video summarizing my strengths and mindset.

6) Contact Section
   - Simple contact form with fields: name, email, message.
   - On submit, POST to backend endpoint `/api/contact`.
   - In the backend, just log the payload to console for now and return a success response (no real email needed).
   - Show success / error state in the UI.

================
BACKEND DETAILS
================

Backend stack: Node.js + Express (JavaScript is fine).

Create the following endpoints:

1. `GET /api/projects`
   - Returns the project list as JSON.
   - Data can be hardcoded in a separate module/file (e.g. `data/projects.js`).

2. `GET /api/certifications` (even if empty at start)
   - Returns JSON array of certifications, each with at least:
     { id, title, issuer, date, link? }

3. `POST /api/contact`
   - Expects JSON: { name, email, message }
   - Validate required fields (basic check).
   - Log the message server-side and return `{ success: true }`.

4. `POST /api/chat`
   - This will be used by the AI chatbot.
   - Request body: { messages: [...], mode?: "default" | "career" | "mentor" }
   - Integrate with an AI provider (OpenAI or Gemini) using an API key stored in environment variables (e.g. `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`).
   - Build a prompt that makes the AI respond as “my” persona:
       - friendly, clear, and concise
       - able to answer questions about my projects, background, skills, and interests using:
         - the project data from `/api/projects`
         - a short “bio” that you hardcode in the backend for now
   - Return the AI’s reply as `{ reply: "..." }`.

Make sure:
- `server/index.js` or similar is clearly the main backend entry.
- CORS is handled properly so frontend can call these endpoints.
- Provide npm scripts for both dev and (basic) production run.

=====================
AI CHATBOT REQUIREMENTS
=====================

Frontend chatbot behavior:

- Show a small round chat bubble fixed at the **bottom-left** of the screen.
- When clicked, it opens a chat window with:
  - Header with title like “Chat with My AI Twin”
  - Scrollable message area
  - Input box with send button
- Maintain chat history in the frontend state.
- On send:
  - Append the user message to history.
  - Send the conversation (recent messages) to `POST /api/chat`.
  - Render the bot reply when it comes back.

Persona & capabilities:

- Speak in first person as if it’s me (but use generic placeholders like “[Your Name]”).
- Answer questions about:
  - Projects (using project data from backend).
  - Skills and interests (using a hardcoded profile in the backend).
- Handle follow-up questions using context (send the last N messages each time).

Optional modes (implement in a simple way):

- Add a small dropdown or buttons in the chat window to switch modes:
  - “Developer Me”
  - “Designer Me”
  - “Mentor Me”
- Pass the selected mode to `/api/chat` so the backend can slightly change the system prompt.

========================
UI/UX & INTERACTIONS
========================

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Make the site fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Add small micro-interactions:
  - Hover effects on buttons/cards.
  - Smooth scroll when navigating sections.
- Add a simple dark/light mode toggle at the top:
  - Use a React state + Tailwind dark class approach.
- Keep the design clean and modern (lots of whitespace, readable typography).

========================
PROJECT STRUCTURE & SCRIPTS
========================

Create a clear, maintainable structure such as:

- `/server`
  - `index.js` (Express app)
  - `routes/` (projects, certifications, contact, chat)
  - `data/` (projects.js, certifications.js)
  - `config/` (aiClient.js or similar)
- `/client`
  - React app with:
    - `src/components/` (Hero, About, Projects, Skills, VideoSection, Contact, ChatBot, Layout, etc.)
    - `src/pages/App.jsx` or `src/main.jsx` depending on setup
    - Tailwind config properly set up

In the root `package.json` (or via workspace):
- Provide convenient scripts like:
  - `"dev"`: runs both frontend and backend (can use `concurrently` if needed)
  - `"server"`: starts Express only
  - `"client"`: starts React dev server
- Clearly comment how to run each.

If Replit prefers a single entry point, make sure:
- The README explains how the dev environment is wired.
- Tell me exactly which command to run in Replit to start everything.

========================
ERROR-FREE, STEP-BY-STEP BUILD STRATEGY
========================

Follow this build strategy:

1. **Plan & Scaffold**
   - Create the basic folder structure (server/client).
   - Initialize Node project(s).
   - Install dependencies:
     - Backend: express, cors, axios (if needed), and AI SDK (like `openai`), dotenv, etc.
     - Frontend: react, react-dom, Vite or CRA, tailwindcss, autoprefixer, postcss, framer-motion (optional).
   - Set up Tailwind in the frontend.

2. **Backend First**
   - Implement `/api/projects` with hardcoded data.
   - Implement `/api/certifications`.
   - Implement `/api/contact`.
   - Test each endpoint with simple fetch or curl inside Replit.
   - Fix ALL errors before moving on.

3. **Frontend Basic Layout**
   - Build the top-level layout, navbar, and sections (Hero, About, Projects, Skills, Video, Contact) with placeholder data.
   - Confirm navigation and responsiveness.
   - No API calls yet; just skeleton content.

4. **Connect Projects to Backend**
   - In Projects section, fetch `/api/projects` and render cards.
   - Add loading and error states.
   - Make sure CORS and URLs are correct in Replit environment.

5. **Chatbot UI**
   - Build floating chat bubble and chat window component.
   - Use local mock responses first to validate UX.

6. **AI Integration**
   - Implement `/api/chat` using OpenAI (or similar) with env variable for API key.
   - Wire the frontend chat to this backend.
   - Add basic context handling: send last 5–10 messages each call.

7. **Contact Form Wiring**
   - Wire POST `/api/contact` from the frontend.
   - Show success or error message.

8. **Polish**
   - Apply Tailwind styling and micro-animations.
   - Add dark/light mode toggle.
   - Remove unused code and console.logs (except useful ones in backend).
   - Check that there are NO TypeScript/JS build errors and no obvious runtime crashes.

At each step:
- Run the relevant `npm run dev` or equivalent in Replit.
- Fix all console errors/warnings that will hurt production readiness.
- Keep code clean and organized.

========================
DELIVERABLES INSIDE REPLIT
========================

- Fully working full-stack project.
- Clear README.md explaining:
  - Tech stack
  - How to run the project locally in Replit
  - Where to configure the AI API key
